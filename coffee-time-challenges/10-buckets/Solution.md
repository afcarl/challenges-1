Some theoretical thoughts:

## Brute Force

### Tuples
A brute force solution would try every possibility to put 13 numbers in 3 bins.
As one can think of 3 bins as additional two elements in an ordered tuple that
would be then number of permutations of 13+2=15 elements.

This is 15! = 1307674368000.

If one check needs 0.01 seconds that are 414 years.
