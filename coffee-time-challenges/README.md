This is a list of the challenges. The difficulty was rated like this:

* 1 - Very easy: Typing it takes most of the time
* 2 - Easy: Have the right idea, then typing it takes most of the time
* 3 - Moderate: You might have to think about this for 15 minutes
* 4 - Hard: You might have to think about it / implement for 30 minutes - 2 hours
* 5 - Very hard: That takes longer than 2 hours, but should be able to be done in a day
* 6 - Ultra hard: Eventually more than a day of work.

The row `BF` indicates if a simple brute force solution is possible.
