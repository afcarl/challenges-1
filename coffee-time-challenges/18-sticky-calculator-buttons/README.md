My daughter just spilled orange juice over my scientific calculator.
The number buttons 0-9 are all stuck (not working), as are the basic
arithmetic functions + - * /

Thankfully, all the scientific buttons work (trig, powers, inverse, exponential, log, root, factorial …)

The display currently reads “0”.

How can I use the buttons that work to make the display show “1”, then press buttons to convert this to a “2”, and finally “3”?
