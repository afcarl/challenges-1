# red = 8.5
# red + blue = 5.25
# blue = ?

# The red only fills in 5.25h only 5.25/8.5 of the pool. So 
# the blue one has to fill in 5.25h (8.5-5.25)/8.5 = 3.25/8.5 = 325/850 = 13/34
# If you gave it only a 1/13th of the time, it would fill only 1/13 of 13/34.
# So: 5.25h/13 is 1/34
# So: 5.25h/13*34 is 1
# So the answer is 5.25/13*34 = 357/26
