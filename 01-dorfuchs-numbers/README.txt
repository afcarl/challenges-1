[GOLF]

Some time ago, the famous artist DorFuchs posted a riddle on his facebook page:

Find all distinct numbers consisting of exactly five characters, where the five characters have to be five successive integers between 0 and 9. 
Numbers with trailing zeros should not be included. 

Format the output as a sorted list, including numbering. 

Example: 

1: 10234
2: 10243
3: 10324
...
694: 98675
695: 98756
696: 98765

This is a golf challenge - the shortest solution wins.
